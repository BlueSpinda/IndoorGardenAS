                                </h2>
                                <p>Before coming to college, I never really "owned" a plant. I watched my father take care of his plants day-to-day, year-to-year. And although I partake in it by watering them from time to time, I did not have a sense of ownership or responsibility. When I came to college, my father propagated for me a small spider plant to put in my dorm. In my tiny dorm room with barely any space, the little spider plant settled above my minifridge and became a source of great joy for me. The joy brought by plants are simple and pure. It does not require much space or money, yet these plants will be your harbor coming home after a long day.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0">
                                    Plants do not grow overnight, but they are always growing, little by little. And the coolest thing about them is that every once in a while, they grow enough such that their change becomes noticeable to us, waving at you gently and quietly to say, "look, I <em>am</em> growing everyday. Thank you for taking care of me." I still remember the first time seeing my spider plant flower. The delicate little white flower that grew out at the end of a thin stem. The joy of nurturing and witnessing growth of my plants soothed and pampered me, led me to the wonders of the plant world. And I hope to take you there.
